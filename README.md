The overall goal is to predict the fuel efficiency of car models based on historical data collected
by the department of energy that can be found at
https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml

Promising features, models and preprocessing methodswere identified and applied
as appropriate.

The measure of fuel efficiency that has been predicted is Combined Unrounded adjusted Fuel
Economy("Comb Unrd Adj FE - Conventional Fuel").

### 1.) Linear Models

Measured performance of a linear model using the existing features with appropriate
preprocessing.

### 2.) Feature Engineering

Built non-linear features or derived features from the provided column. Tried to improve the
performance of the linear model with these.

### 3.) Advanced Models

Used trees, forests, gradient boosting, SVM to improve
the result. 

### 4.) Feature Selection

Identified features that are important for the best model. Found which features are most influential,
and which features could be removed without decrease in performance? Did Recursive Feature Selection using Gradient Boosting Regresser.
